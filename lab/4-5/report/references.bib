Consequently, fault tolerance, historically of interest only for mission-critical systems, is now gaining attention in the mainstream computing space. Traditionally reliability issues have been addressed at a coarse granularity, e.g., by disabling faulty cores in chip multiprocessors. However, this is not scalable to higher failure rates. In this paper, we propose {StageWeb}, a fine-grained wearout and variation tolerance solution, that employs a reconfigurable web of replicated processor pipeline stages to construct dependable many-core chips. The interconnection flexibility of {StageWeb} simultaneously tackles wearout failures (by isolating broken stages) and process variation (by selectively disabling slower stages). Our experiments show that through its wearout tolerance, a {StageWeb} chip performs up to 70\% more cumulative work than a comparable chip multiprocessor. Further, variation mitigation in {StageWeb} enables it to scale supply voltage more aggressively, resulting in up to 16\% energy savings.},

	abstract = {To protect processor logic from soft errors, multicore redundant architectures execute two copies of a program on separate cores of a chip multiprocessor ({CMP}). Maintaining identical instruction streams is challenging because redundant cores operate independently, yet must still receive the same inputs (e.g., load values and shared-memory invalidations). Past proposals strictly replicate load values across two cores, requiring significant changes to the highly-optimized core. We make the key observation that, in the common case, both cores load identical values without special hardware. When the cores do receive different load values (e.g., due to a data race), the same mechanisms employed for soft error detection and recovery can correct the difference. This observation permits designs that relax input replication, while still providing correct redundant execution. In this paper, we present Reunion, an execution model that provides relaxed input replication and preserves the existing memory interface, coherence protocols, and consistency models. We evaluate a {CMP}-based implementation of the Reunion execution model with full-system, cycle-accurate simulation. We show that the performance overhead of relaxed input replication is only 5\% and 6\% for commercial and scientific workloads, respectively.},

	doi = {10.1109/DSN.2007.100},
	abstract = {Aggressive {CMOS} scaling will make future chip multiprocessors ({CMPs}) increasingly susceptible to transient faults, hard errors, manufacturing defects, and process variations. Existing fault-tolerant {CMP} proposals that implement dual modular redundancy ({DMR}) do so by statically binding pairs of adjacent cores via dedicated communication channels and buffers. This can result in unnecessary power and performance losses in cases where one core is defective (in which case the entire {DMR} pair must be disabled), or when cores exhibit different frequency/leakage characteristics due to process variations (in which case the pair runs at the speed of the slowest core). Static {DMR} also hinders power density/thermal management, as {DMR} pairs running code with similar power/thermal characteristics are necessarily placed next to each other on the die. We present dynamic core coupling ({DCC}), an architectural technique that allows arbitrary {CMP} cores to verify each other's execution while requiring no static core binding at design time or dedicated communication hardware. Our evaluation shows that the performance overhead of {DCC} over a {CMP} without fault tolerance is 3\% on {SPEC}2000 benchmarks, and is within 5\% for a set of scalable parallel scientific and data mining applications with up to eight threads (16 processors). Our results also show that {DCC} has the potential to significantly outperform existing static {DMR} schemes.},

	abstract = {{CMOS} scaling has long been a source of dramatic performance gains. However, semiconductor feature size reduction has resulted in increasing levels of operating temperatures and current densities. Given that most wearout mechanisms are highly dependent on these parameters, significantly higher failure rates are projected for future technology generations. Consequently, fault tolerance, which has traditionally been a subject of interest for high-end server markets, is now getting emphasis in the mainstream computing systems space. The popular solution for this has been the use of redundancy at a coarse granularity, such as dual/triple modular redundancy. In this work, we challenge the practice of coarse-granularity redundancy by identifying its inability to scale to high failure rate scenarios and investigating the advantages of finer-grained configurations. To this end, this paper presents and evaluates a highly reconfigurable {CMP} architecture, named as {StageNet} ({SN}), that is designed with reliability as its first-class design criteria. {SN} relies on a reconfigurable network of replicated processor pipeline stages to maximize the useful lifetime of a chip, gracefully degrading performance toward the end of life. Our results show that the proposed {SN} architecture can perform 40 percent more cumulative work compared to a traditional {CMP} over 12 years of its lifetime.},

We quantify the {SER} due to high-energy neutrons in {SRAM} cells, latches, and logic circuits for feature sizes from 600 nm to 50 nm and clock periods from 16 to 6 fan-out-of-4 inverter delays. Our model predicts that the {SER} per chip of logic circuits will increase nine orders of magnitude from 1992 to 2011 and at that point will be comparable to the {SER} per chip of unprotected memory elements.

On the one hand, it supports confirmation of {IP} infringement and detection of circuit malicious manipulations, on the other hand it provides adversaries with crucial information to plagiarize designs, infringe on {IP}, or implant hardware Trojans into a target circuit. Although reverse engineering is commonplace in practice, the quantification of its complexity is an unsolved problem to date since both technical and human factors have to be accounted for. A sophisticated understanding of this complexity is crucial in order to provide a reasonable threat estimation and to develop sound countermeasures, i.e. obfuscation transformations of the target circuit, to mitigate risks for the modern {IC} landscape. The contribution of our work is threefold: first, we systematically study the current research branches related to hardware reverse engineering ranging from decapsulation to gate-level netlist analysis. Based on our overview, we formulate several open research questions to scientifically quantify reverse engineering, including technical and human factors. Second, we survey research on problem solving and on the acquisition of expertise and discuss its potential to quantify human factors in reverse engineering. Third, we propose novel directions for future interdisciplinary research encompassing both technical and psychological perspectives that hold the promise to holistically capture the complexity of hardware reverse engineering.},

	abstract = {Transactional memory is a programming model that attempts to make parallel programming easier. Transactional memory uses either eager (at encounter time) or lazy (at commit time) validation to check for conflicting accesses between concurrent transactions, and researchers have been divided over which approach is best. Despite this, there is little work in the literature evaluating their comparative performance. One exploration of this topic using microbenchmarks found that lazy outperforms eager and increases its advantage as contention rises. Furthermore, eager was prone to livelock when accesses were irregular, which resulted in starvation and low throughput. We revisit the comparative performance of eager and lazy under contention using a larger set of microbenchmarks, more complex benchmarks from {STAMP}, and against multiple state-of-the-art {STMs}: word-based {RSTM}, {TinySTM} and {SwissTM}. We validate earlier findings that eager suffers from livelock, especially when accesses are irregular. This inspired Purge-Rehab: a lightweight mechanism for controlling transaction restarts in eager validation to reduce livelock and thus improve throughput and reduce starvation. Compared to lazy validation, Purge-Rehab achieves higher performance in five benchmarks, similar in four, and is lower in only one, showing that eager validation can achieve high performance under contention. Purge-Rehab is implemented in word-based {RSTM}, but is applicable to any eager {STM}.},

Notably, many open research questions regarding the extraction of functionally correct netlists from Field Programmable Gate Arrays ({FPGAs}) or Application Specific Integrated Circuits ({ASICs}) have been tackled. In order to facilitate further analysis of recovered netlists, a software framework is required, serving as the foundation for specialized algorithms.

Unlike the previous work that commonly applies one-size-fits-all dataflows regardless of the data structure of the {DNN} model, we have shown quantitatively that much better results could be achieved with the highly adaptive {RS} dataflow. This analysis is made possible thanks to our framework that can systematically analyze and evaluate the system energy efficiency of different dataflows working for different shapes and sizes of {DNNs}. We observe that {DRAM} alone does not dictate energy efficiency, and optimizing the energy consumption for only a certain data type does not lead to the best overall system energy efficiency. For {AlexNet}, the {RS} dataflow is 1.4 to 2.5 times more energy efficient than existing dataflows in the convolutional layers, and at least 1.3 times more energy efficient in the fully-connected layers for batch size of at least 16.},

These endeavors aim to reduce the {DNN} model size and improve the hardware processing efficiency, and have resulted in {DNNs} that are much more compact in their structures and/or have high data sparsity. These compact or sparse models are different from the traditional large ones in that there is much more variation in their layer shapes and sizes, and often require specialized hardware to exploit sparsity for performance improvement. Thus, many {DNN} accelerators designed for large {DNNs} do not perform well on these models. In this work, we present Eyeriss v2, a {DNN} accelerator architecture designed for running compact and sparse {DNNs}. To deal with the widely varying layer shapes and sizes, it introduces a highly flexible on-chip network, called hierarchical mesh, that can adapt to the different amounts of data reuse and bandwidth requirements of different data types, which improves the utilization of the computation resources. Furthermore, Eyeriss v2 can process sparse data directly in the compressed domain for both weights and activations, and therefore is able to improve both processing speed and energy efficiency with sparse models. Overall, with sparse {MobileNet}, Eyeriss v2 in a 65nm {CMOS} process achieves a throughput of 1470.6 inferences/sec and 2560.3 inferences/J at a batch size of 1, which is 12.6x faster and 2.5x more energy efficient than the original Eyeriss running {MobileNet}. We also present an analysis methodology called Eyexam that provides a systematic way of understanding the performance limits for {DNN} processors as a function of specific characteristics of the {DNN} model and accelerator design; it applies these characteristics as sequential steps to increasingly tighten the bound on the performance limits.},

	doi = {10.1109/SP.2017.31},
	shorttitle = {Stack Overflow Considered Harmful?},
	abstract = {Online programming discussion platforms such as Stack Overflow serve as a rich source of information for software developers. Available information include vibrant discussions and oftentimes ready-to-use code snippets. Previous research identified Stack Overflow as one of the most important information sources developers rely on. Anecdotes report that software developers copy and paste code snippets from those information sources for convenience reasons. Such behavior results in a constant flow of community-provided code snippets into production software. To date, the impact of this behaviour on code security is unknown. We answer this highly important question by quantifying the proliferation of security-related code snippets from Stack Overflow in Android applications available on Google Play. Access to the rich source of information available on Stack Overflow including ready-to-use code snippets provides huge benefits for software developers. However, when it comes to code security there are some caveats to bear in mind: Due to the complex nature of code security, it is very difficult to provide ready-to-use and secure solutions for every problem. Hence, integrating a security-related code snippet from Stack Overflow into production software requires caution and expertise. Unsurprisingly, we observed insecure code snippets being copied into Android applications millions of users install from Google Play every day. To quantitatively evaluate the extent of this observation, we scanned Stack Overflow for code snippets and evaluated their security score using a stochastic gradient descent classifier. In order to identify code reuse in Android applications, we applied state-of-the-art static analysis. Our results are alarming: 15.4\% of the 1.3 million Android applications we analyzed, contained security-related code snippets from Stack Overflow. Out of these 97.9\% contain at least one insecure code snippet.},

We start by presenting new findings based on a series of semi-structured interviews with Android developers, probing into the difficulties with privacy that developers face when building apps. Based on these findings, we implemented a proof-of-concept prototype of Coconut and evaluated it in a controlled lab study with 18 Android developers (including eight professional developers). Our study results suggest that apps developed with Coconut handled privacy concerns better, and the developers that used Coconut had a better understanding of their code's behavior and wrote a better privacy policy for their app. We also found that requiring developers to do a small amount of annotating work regarding their apps' personal data practices during the development process may result in a significant improvement in app privacy.},

	title = {Stack Overflow Considered Helpful! Deep Learning Security Nudges Towards Stronger Cryptography},
	abstract = {Stack Overflow is the most popular discussion platform for software developers. However, recent research identified a large amount of insecure encryption code in production systems that has been inspired by examples given on Stack Overflow. By copying and pasting functional code, developers introduced exploitable software vulnerabilities into security-sensitive high-profile applications installed by millions of users every day. Proposed mitigations of this problem suffer from usability flaws and push developers to continue shopping for code examples on Stack Overflow once again. This motivates us to fight the proliferation of insecure code directly at the root before it even reaches the clipboard. By viewing Stack Overflow as a market, implementation of cryptography becomes a decision-making problem. In this context, our goal is to simplify the selection of helpful and secure examples. More specifically, we focus on supporting software developers in making better decisions on Stack Overflow by applying nudges, a concept borrowed from behavioral economics and psychology. This approach is motivated by one of our key findings: For 99.37\% of insecure code examples on Stack Overflow, similar alternatives are available that serve the same use case and provide strong cryptography. Our system design that modifies Stack Overflow is based on several nudges that are controlled by a deep neural network. It learns a representation for cryptographic {API} usage patterns and classification of their security, achieving average {AUC}-{ROC} of 0.992. With a user study, we demonstrate that nudge-based security advice significantly helps tackling the most popular and error-prone cryptographic use cases in Android.},

This paper investigates the security and privacy (S\&P) perceptions, experiences, and practices of current Computer Science students at the graduate and undergraduate level using semi-structured interviews. We find that the attitudes of students already match many of those that have been observed in professional level developers. Students have a range of hacker and attack mindsets, lack of experience with security {APIs}, a mixed view of who is in charge of S\&P in the software life cycle, and a tendency to trust other peoples’ code as a convenient approach to rapidly build software. We discuss the impact of our results on both curriculum development and support for professional developers.},

Frequently, Android developers fail to adhere to security best practices, leaving applications vulnerable to a multitude of attacks. We point out the advantage of a low-time-cost tool both to teach better secure coding and to improve app security. Using the {FixDroid} {IDE} plug-in, we show that professional and hobby app developers can work with and learn from an in-environment tool without it impacting their normal work; and by performing studies with both students and professional developers, we identify key {UI} requirements and demonstrate that code delivered with such a tool by developers previously inexperienced in security contains significantly less security problems. Perfecting and adding such tools to the Android development environment is an essential step in getting both security and privacy for the next generation of apps.},

	abstract = {Vulnerabilities in Android code – including but not limited to insecure data storage, unprotected inter-component communication, broken {TLS} implementations, and violations of least privilege – have enabled real-world privacy leaks and motivated research cataloguing their prevalence and impact. Researchers have speculated that appification promotes security problems, as it increasingly allows inexperienced laymen to develop complex and sensitive apps. Anecdotally, Internet resources such as Stack Overflow are blamed for promoting insecure solutions that are naively copy-pasted by inexperienced developers. In this paper, we for the first time systematically analyzed how the use of information resources impacts code security. We first surveyed 295 app developers who have published in the Google Play market concerning how they use resources to solve security-related problems. Based on the survey results, we conducted a lab study with 54 Android developers (students and professionals), in which participants wrote security-and privacy-relevant code under time constraints. The participants were assigned to one of four conditions: free choice of resources, Stack Overflow only, official Android documentation only, or books only. Those participants who were allowed to use only Stack Overflow produced significantly less secure code than those using, the official Android documentation or books, while participants using the official Android documentation produced significantly less functional code than those using Stack Overflow. To assess the quality of Stack Overflow as a resource, we surveyed the 139 threads our participants accessed during the study, finding that only 25\% of them were helpful in solving the assigned tasks and only 17\% of them contained secure code snippets. In order to obtain ground truth concerning the prevalence of the secure and insecure code our participants wrote in the lab study, we statically analyzed a random sample of 200,000 apps from Google Play, finding that 93.6\% of the apps used at least one of the {API} calls our participants used during our study. We also found that many of the security errors made by our participants also appear in the wild, possibly also originating in the use of Stack Overflow to solve programming problems. Taken together, our results confirm that {API} documentation is secure but hard to use, while informal documentation such as Stack Overflow is more accessible but often leads to insecurity. Given time constraints and economic pressures, we can expect that Android developers will continue to choose those resources that are easiest to use, therefore, our results firmly establish the need for secure-but-usable documentation.},

Previous studies have shown that the state of non-browser {SSL} code is catastrophic across a large variety of desktop applications and libraries as well as a large selection of Android apps, leaving users vulnerable to Man-in-the-Middle attacks ({MITMAs}). To determine possible causes of {SSL} problems on all major appified platforms, we extended the analysis to the walled-garden ecosystem of {iOS}, analyzed software developer forums and conducted interviews with developers of vulnerable apps. Our results show that the root causes are not simply careless developers, but also limitations and issues of the current {SSL} development paradigm. Based on our findings, we derive a proposal to rethink the handling of {SSL} in the appified world and present a set of countermeasures to improve the handling of {SSL} using Android as a blueprint for other platforms. Our countermeasures prevent developers from willfully or accidentally breaking {SSL} certificate validation, offer support for extended features such as {SSL} Pinning and different {SSL} validation infrastructures, and protect users. We evaluated our solution against 13,500 popular Android apps and conducted developer interviews to judge the acceptance of our approach and found that our solution works well for all investigated apps and developers.},

When not explicitly enabled, {DTrace} has zero probe effect — the system operates exactly as if {DTrace} were not present at all. {DTrace} allows for many tens of thousands of instrumentation points, with even the smallest of systems offering on the order of 30,000 such points in the kernel alone. We have developed a C-like high-level control language to describe the predicates and actions at a given point of instrumentation. The language features user-deﬁned variables, including threadlocal variables and associative arrays. To eliminate the need for most postprocessing, the facility features a scalable mechanism for aggregating data and a mechanism for speculative tracing. {DTrace} has been integrated into the Solaris operating system and has been used to ﬁnd serious systemic performance problems on production systems — problems that could not be found using preexisting facilities.},

The key privacy guarantee that has emerged is differential privacy. Roughly speaking, this ensures that (almost, and quantifiably) no risk is incurred by joining a statistical database.In this survey, we recall the definition of differential privacy and two basic techniques for achieving it.

	abstract = {If our paper has stood the test of time, it is because the core technical insight goes back at least 60 years: a small number of data points about an individual, none of which are uniquely identifying, are collectively equivalent to an identifier. Some of the early papers that explored this idea are by Newcombe et al. [20], Fellegi \&amp; Sunter [10], and Schlörer [22]. But the focus of this line of research, up to and including Sweeney’s seminal work [25], had been on demographic attributes, because that’s what was collected in databases at the time. Perhaps the main lesson of our paper is that data collection has grown so comprehensive that de-anonymization need no longer rely on demographic attributes. Techniques for protecting against de-anonymization such as making a few attributes more coarse-grained break down for datasets of watched movies or browsing histories or visited locations when these datasets contain hundreds or thousands of observations per individual. We and other researchers have since demonstrated robust de-anonymization techniques in many other domains: social networks [18, 16], genetic data [12, 9, 8], location data [11, 27, 5], credit card data [6], browsing histories [23], writing style [15], source code [3], and compiled binaries [2]. This line of research has firmly established that high-dimensional data is inherently vulnerable to deanonymization. This is also supported by theoretical evidence [4]. When we consider the fact that 33 bits of entropy are sufficient to identify an individual uniquely among the world’s population, these research findings should be no surprise.},

	url = {http://arxiv.org/abs/1709.02753},
	abstract = {In June 2016, Apple announced that it will deploy differential privacy for some user data collection in order to ensure privacy of user data, even from Apple. The details of Apple's approach remained sparse. Although several patents have since appeared hinting at the algorithms that may be used to achieve differential privacy, they did not include a precise explanation of the approach taken to privacy parameter choice. Such choice and the overall approach to privacy budget use and management are key questions for understanding the privacy protections provided by any deployment of differential privacy. In this work, through a combination of experiments, static and dynamic code analysis of {macOS} Sierra (Version 10.12) implementation, we shed light on the choices Apple made for privacy budget management. We discover and describe Apple's set-up for differentially private data processing, including the overall data pipeline, the parameters used for differentially private perturbation of each piece of data, and the frequency with which such data is sent to Apple's servers. We find that although Apple's deployment ensures that the (differential) privacy loss per each datum submitted to its servers is \$1\$ or \$2\$, the overall privacy loss permitted by the system is significantly higher, as high as \$16\$ per day for the four initially announced applications of Emojis, New words, Deeplinks and Lookup Hints. Furthermore, Apple renews the privacy budget available every day, which leads to a possible privacy loss of 16 times the number of days since user opt-in to differentially private data collection for those four applications. We advocate that in order to claim the full benefits of differentially private data collection, Apple must give full transparency of its implementation, enable user choice in areas related to privacy loss, and set meaningful defaults on the privacy loss permitted.},

We give a general impossibility result showing that a formalization of Dalenius' goal along the lines of semantic security cannot be achieved. Contrary to intuition, a variant of the result threatens the privacy even of someone not in the database. This state of affairs suggests a new measure, differential privacy, which, intuitively, captures the increased risk to one's privacy incurred by participating in a database. The techniques developed in a sequence of papers [8, 13, 3], culminating in those described in [12], can achieve any desired level of privacy under this measure. In many cases, extremely accurate information about the database can be provided while simultaneously ensuring very high levels of privacy},

	abstract = {The problem of privacy-preserving data analysis has a long history spanning multiple disciplines. As electronic data about individuals becomes increasingly detailed, and as technology enables ever more powerful collection and curation of these data, the need increases for a robust, meaningful, and mathematically rigorous definition of privacy, together with a computationally rich class of algorithms that satisfy this definition. Differential Privacy is such a definition.After motivating and discussing the meaning of differential privacy, the preponderance of this monograph is devoted to fundamental techniques for achieving differential privacy, and application of these techniques in creative combinations, using the query-release problem as an ongoing example. A key point is that, by rethinking the computational goal, one can often obtain far better results than would be achieved by methodically replacing each step of a non-private computation with a differentially private implementation. Despite some astonishingly powerful computational results, there are still fundamental limitations — not just on what can be achieved with differential privacy but on what can be achieved with any method that protects against a complete breakdown in privacy. Virtually all the algorithms discussed herein maintain differential privacy against adversaries of arbitrary computational power. Certain algorithms are computationally intensive, others are efficient. Computational complexity for the adversary and the algorithm are both discussed.We then turn from fundamentals to applications other than queryrelease, discussing differentially private methods for mechanism design and machine learning. The vast majority of the literature on differentially private algorithms considers a single, static, database that is subject to many analyses. Differential privacy in other models, including distributed databases and computations on data streams is discussed.Finally, we note that this work is meant as a thorough introduction to the problems and techniques of differential privacy, but is not intended to be an exhaustive survey — there is by now a vast amount of work in differential privacy, and we can cover only a small portion of it.},

	title = {Data Privacy Beyond Differential Privacy},
	abstract = {Computing technologies today have made it much easier to gather personal data, ranging from {GPS} locations to medical records, from online behavior to social exchanges. As algorithms are constantly analyzing such detailed personal information for a wide range of computations, data privacy emerges as a paramount concern. As a strong, meaningful and rigorous notion of privacy, Differential Privacy has provided a powerful framework for designing data analysis algorithms with provable privacy guarantees. Over the past decade, there has been tremendous progress in the theory and algorithms for differential privacy, most of which consider the setting of centralized computation where a single, static database is subject to many data analyses. However, this standard framework does not capture many complex issues in modern computation. For example, the data might be distributed across self-interested agents, who may have incentive to misreport their data; and different individuals in the computation may have different expectations to privacy. The goal of this dissertation is to bring the rich theory of differential privacy to several computational problems in practice. We start by studying the problem of private counting query release for high-dimensional data, for which there are well-known computational hardness results. Despite the worst-case intractability barrier, we provide a solution with practical empirical performances by leveraging powerful optimization heuristics. Then we tackle problems within different social and economic settings, where the standard notion of differential privacy is not applicable. To that end, we use the perspective of differential privacy to design algorithms with meaningful privacy guarantees. (1) We provide privacy-preserving algorithms for solving a family of economic optimization problems under a strong relaxation of the standard definition of differential privacy---joint differential privacy. (2) We also show that (joint) differential privacy can serve as a novel tool for mechanism design when solving these optimization problems: Under our private mechanisms, the agents are incentivized to behave truthfully. (3) Finally, we consider the problem of using social network metadata to guide a search for some class of targeted individuals (for whom we cannot provide any meaningful privacy guarantees). We give a new variant of differential privacy---protected differential privacy---that guarantees differential privacy only for a subgroup of protected individuals. Under this privacy notion, we provide a family of algorithms for searching targeted individuals in the network while ensuring the privacy for the protected (un-targeted) ones.

Privacy is typically protected by anonymization, i.e., removing names, addresses, etc.We present a framework for analyzing privacy and anonymity in social networks and develop a new re-identification algorithm targeting anonymized social-network graphs. To demonstrate its effectiveness on real-world networks, we show that a third of the users who can be verified to have accounts on both Twitter, a popular microblogging service, and Flickr, an online photo-sharing site, can be re-identified in the anonymous Twitter graph with only a 12\% error rate.Our de-anonymization algorithm is based purely on the network topology, does not require creation of a large number of dummy "sybil" nodes, is robust to noise and all existing defenses, and works even when the overlap between the target network and the adversary's auxiliary information is small.},

Approximately one-third of this edition’s content is completely new, and another one-third has been extensively rewritten.   Three long-time {FreeBSD} project leaders begin with a concise overview of the {FreeBSD} kernel’s current design and implementation. Next, they cover the {FreeBSD} kernel from the system-call level down–from the interface to the kernel to the hardware. Explaining key design decisions, they detail the concepts, data structures, and algorithms used in implementing each significant system facility, including process management, security, virtual memory, the I/O system, filesystems, socket {IPC}, and networking.   This Second Edition   • Explains highly scalable and lightweight virtualization using {FreeBSD} jails, and virtual-machine acceleration with Xen and Virtio device paravirtualization   • Describes new security features such as Capsicum sandboxing and {GELI} cryptographic disk protection   • Fully covers {NFSv}4 and Open Solaris {ZFS} support   • Introduces {FreeBSD}’s enhanced volume management and new journaled soft updates   • Explains {DTrace}’s fine-grained process debugging/profiling   • Reflects major improvements to networking, wireless, and {USB} support   Readers can use this guide as both a working reference and an in-depth study of a leading contemporary, portable, open source operating system. Technical and sales support professionals will discover both {FreeBSD}’s capabilities and its limitations. Applications developers will learn how to effectively and efficiently interface with it; system administrators will learn how to maintain, tune, and configure it; and systems programmers will learn how to extend, enhance, and interface with it.   Marshall Kirk {McKusick} writes, consults, and teaches classes on {UNIX}- and {BSD}-related subjects.

Both industry and academia have repeatedly demonstrated tagged memory as a key mechanism to enable enforcement of powerful security invariants, including capabilities, pointer integrity, watchpoints, and information-flow tracking. A single-bit tag shadowspace is the most commonly proposed requirement, as one bit is the minimum metadata needed to distinguish between an untyped data word and any number of new hardware-enforced types. We survey various tag shadowspace approaches and identify their common requirements and positive features of their implementations. To avoid non-standard memory widths, we identify the most practical implementation for tag storage to be an in-memory table managed next to the {DRAM} controller. We characterize the caching performance of such a tag table and demonstrate a {DRAM} traffic overhead below 5\% for the vast majority of applications. We identify spatial locality on a page scale as the primary factor that enables surprisingly high table cache-ability. We then demonstrate tag-table compression for a set of common applications. A hierarchical structure with elegantly simple optimizations reduces {DRAM} traffic overhead to below 1\% for most applications. These insights and optimizations pave the way for commercial applications making use of single-bit tags stored in commodity memory.},

	abstract = {We present an experimental study showing that soft memory errors can lead to serious security vulnerabilities in Java and .{NET} virtual machines, or in any system that relies on type-checking of untrusted programs as a protection mechanism. Our attack works by sending to the {JVM} a Java program that is designed so that almost any memory error in its address space will allow it to take control of the {JVM}. All conventional Java and .{NET} virtual machines are vulnerable to this attack. The technique of the attack is broadly applicable against other language-based security schemes such as proof-carrying code. We measured the attack on two commercial Java virtual machines: Sun's and {IBM}'s. We show that a single-bit error in the Java program's data space can be exploited to execute arbitrary code with a probability of about 70\%, and multiple-bit errors with a lower probability. Our attack is particularly relevant against smart cards or tamper-resistant computers, where the user has physical access (to the outside of the computer) and can use various means to induce faults; we have successfully used heat. Fortunately, there are some straightforward defenses against this attack.},

	abstract = {Recent revelations of new side-channel vulnerabilities in modern processors has made hardware security a first-order concern in processor design. We demonstrate how the Berkeley Out-of-Order Machine ({BOOM}), a generic open-source out-of-order {RISC}-V processor, is useful for studying the performance and security implications of microarchitectural mitigations for side-channel attacks. Two results are presented. First we replicate several basic variants of Spectre attacks which exploit the effects of speculative execution in the L1 data cache. We then implement a preliminary hardware mitigation for such attacks, demonstrate its effectiveness, and measure its impact on performance, and area. Compared to the baseline processor, our mitigation displays a 2\% {IPC} improvement, a 2.5\% area increase, and a 0.36\% clock reduction in a 45nm process. To our knowledge, our work is the first available demonstration on an open-source {RISC}-V processor of speculative side-channel attacks and a potential hardware mitigation. Our methodology demonstrates the value of the open-source {RISC}-V hardware ecosystem for secure hardware research.},

	abstract = {Gaining reliable arbitrary code execution through the exploitation of memory corruption vulnerabilities is becoming increasingly more difficult in the face of modern exploit mitigations. Facing this challenge, adversaries have started shifting their attention to data leakage attacks, which can lead to equally damaging outcomes, such as the disclosure of private keys or other sensitive data. In this work, we present a compiler-level defense against data leakage attacks for user-space applications. Our approach strikes a balance between the manual effort required to protect sensitive application data, and the performance overhead of achieving strong data confidentiality. To that end, we require developers to simply annotate those variables holding sensitive data, after which our framework automatically transforms only the fraction of the entire program code that is related to sensitive data operations. We implemented this approach by extending the {LLVM} compiler, and used it to protect memory-resident private keys in the {MbedTLS} server, ssh-agent, and a Libsodium-based file signing program, as well as user passwords for Lighttpd and Memcached. Our results demonstrate the feasibility and practicality of our technique: a modest runtime overhead (e.g., 13\% throughput reduction for {MbedTLS}) that is on par with, or better than, existing state-of-the-art memory safety approaches for selective data protection.},

One of the most active parts of the Bitcoin ecosystem was the Silk Road marketplace, in which highly illegal substances and services were traded. It was run by a person who called himself Dread Pirate Roberts ({DPR}), whose bitcoin holdings are estimated to be worth hundreds of millions of dollars at today’s exchange rate. On October 1-st 2013, the {FBI} arrested a 29 year old person named Ross William Ulbricht, claiming that he is {DPR}, and seizing a small fraction of his bitcoin wealth. In this paper we use the publicly available record to trace the evolution of his holdings in order to find how he acquired and how he tried to hide them from the authorities. In particular, we trace the amounts he seemingly received and the amounts he seemingly transferred out of his accounts, and show that all his Silk Road commissions from the months of May, June and September 2013, along with numerous other amounts, were not seized by the {FBI}. This analysis demonstrates the power of data mining techniques in analyzing large payment systems, and especially publicly available transaction graphs of the type provided by the Bitcoin scheme.},

	shorttitle = {The Postmodern Ponzi Scheme},
	abstract = {A High Yield Investment Program ({HYIP}) is an online Ponzi scheme, a financial fraud that pays outrageous levels of interest using money from new investors. We call this fraud ‘postmodern’ in that sophisticated investors understand the fraud, but hope to profit by joining early. These investors support ‘aggregators’ – reputation websites that track the status of {HYIPs}. We examine 9 months of aggregator data and show that there is no evidence of collusion between different aggregators. We use their data to measure the time until {HYIPs} collapse, finding – perhaps unsurprisingly – that longer lifetimes are associated with lower interest payments and longer mandatory investment terms. We look at the role of digital currencies in supporting {HYIPs}, finding that a handful of systems dominate. Finally, we estimate that this type of criminality is turning over at least \$6 million/month and set out ways in which it might be disrupted.},

	abstract = {A purely peer-to-peer version of electronic cash would allow online payments to be sent directly from one party to another without going through a financial institution. Digital signatures provide part of the solution, but the main benefits are lost if a trusted third party is still required to prevent double-spending. We propose a solution to the double-spending problem using a peer-to-peer network. The network timestamps transactions by hashing them into an ongoing chain of hash-based proof-of-work, forming a record that cannot be changed without redoing the proof-of-work. The longest chain not only serves as proof of the sequence of events witnessed, but proof that it came from the largest pool of {CPU} power. As long as a majority of {CPU} power is controlled by nodes that are not cooperating to attack the network, they'll generate the longest chain and outpace attackers. The network itself requires minimal structure. Messages are broadcast on a best effort basis, and nodes can leave and rejoin the network at will, accepting the longest proof-of-work chain as proof of what happened while they were gone.},

These allow us to keep the core language of {QIL} small and allow us to treat memory and register values as logical formulae, for example, in order to support symbolic execution.
