	abstract = {This paper presents {DTrace}, a new facility for dynamic instrumentation of production systems. {DTrace} features the ability to dynamically instrument both user-level and kernel-level software in a uniﬁed and absolutely safe fashion. When not explicitly enabled, {DTrace} has zero probe effect — the system operates exactly as if {DTrace} were not present at all. {DTrace} allows for many tens of thousands of instrumentation points, with even the smallest of systems offering on the order of 30,000 such points in the kernel alone. We have developed a C-like high-level control language to describe the predicates and actions at a given point of instrumentation. The language features user-deﬁned variables, including threadlocal variables and associative arrays. To eliminate the need for most postprocessing, the facility features a scalable mechanism for aggregating data and a mechanism for speculative tracing. {DTrace} has been integrated into the Solaris operating system and has been used to ﬁnd serious systemic performance problems on production systems — problems that could not be found using preexisting facilities.},

	title = {The Design and Implementation of the {FreeBSD} Operating System},
	isbn = {978-0-321-96897-5},
	abstract = {The most complete, authoritative technical guide to the {FreeBSD} kernel’s internal structure has now been extensively updated to cover all major improvements between Versions 5 and 11. Approximately one-third of this edition’s content is completely new, and another one-third has been extensively rewritten.   Three long-time {FreeBSD} project leaders begin with a concise overview of the {FreeBSD} kernel’s current design and implementation. Next, they cover the {FreeBSD} kernel from the system-call level down–from the interface to the kernel to the hardware. Explaining key design decisions, they detail the concepts, data structures, and algorithms used in implementing each significant system facility, including process management, security, virtual memory, the I/O system, filesystems, socket {IPC}, and networking.   This Second Edition   • Explains highly scalable and lightweight virtualization using {FreeBSD} jails, and virtual-machine acceleration with Xen and Virtio device paravirtualization   • Describes new security features such as Capsicum sandboxing and {GELI} cryptographic disk protection   • Fully covers {NFSv}4 and Open Solaris {ZFS} support   • Introduces {FreeBSD}’s enhanced volume management and new journaled soft updates   • Explains {DTrace}’s fine-grained process debugging/profiling   • Reflects major improvements to networking, wireless, and {USB} support   Readers can use this guide as both a working reference and an in-depth study of a leading contemporary, portable, open source operating system. Technical and sales support professionals will discover both {FreeBSD}’s capabilities and its limitations. Applications developers will learn how to effectively and efficiently interface with it; system administrators will learn how to maintain, tune, and configure it; and systems programmers will learn how to extend, enhance, and interface with it.   Marshall Kirk {McKusick} writes, consults, and teaches classes on {UNIX}- and {BSD}-related subjects. While at the University of California, Berkeley, he implemented the 4.2BSD fast filesystem. He was research computer scientist at the Berkeley Computer Systems Research Group ({CSRG}), overseeing development and release of 4.3BSD and 4.4BSD. He is a {FreeBSD} Foundation board member and a long-time {FreeBSD} committer. Twice president of the Usenix Association, he is also a member of {ACM}, {IEEE}, and {AAAS}.   George V. Neville-Neil hacks, writes, teaches, and consults on security, networking, and operating systems. A {FreeBSD} Foundation board member, he served on the {FreeBSD} Core Team for four years. Since 2004, he has written the “Kode Vicious” column for Queue and Communications of the {ACM}. He is vice chair of {ACM}’s Practitioner Board and a member of Usenix Association, {ACM}, {IEEE}, and {AAAS}.   Robert N.M. Watson is a University Lecturer in systems, security, and architecture in the Security Research Group at the University of Cambridge Computer Laboratory. He supervises advanced research in computer architecture, compilers, program analysis, operating systems, networking, and security. A {FreeBSD} Foundation board member, he served on the Core Team for ten years and has been a committer for fifteen years. He is a member of Usenix Association and {ACM}.},
