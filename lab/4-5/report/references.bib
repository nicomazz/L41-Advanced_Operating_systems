	abstract = {This paper presents {DTrace}, a new facility for dynamic instrumentation of production systems. {DTrace} features the ability to dynamically instrument both user-level and kernel-level software in a uniﬁed and absolutely safe fashion. When not explicitly enabled, {DTrace} has zero probe effect — the system operates exactly as if {DTrace} were not present at all. {DTrace} allows for many tens of thousands of instrumentation points, with even the smallest of systems offering on the order of 30,000 such points in the kernel alone. We have developed a C-like high-level control language to describe the predicates and actions at a given point of instrumentation. The language features user-deﬁned variables, including threadlocal variables and associative arrays. To eliminate the need for most postprocessing, the facility features a scalable mechanism for aggregating data and a mechanism for speculative tracing. {DTrace} has been integrated into the Solaris operating system and has been used to ﬁnd serious systemic performance problems on production systems — problems that could not be found using preexisting facilities.},
